      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallas%27s_cat"> Pallas cat</a> also knowns as a <span class="highlight">Otocolobus manul</span> is a small but might wild cat with long dense fur and round ears set low on the sides of the head that lives in the steppes of Central Asia. Their silvery or orangey-buff coloration provides the perfect camouflage in the terrain of this inhospitable, sparsely populated grassland region. Their tail is around half the length of its body and they can be seen using their tails to keep their paws warm by standing on it. They are solitary and elusive animals and despite their round, stocky and comical appearance they are not friendly to humans.</p>
